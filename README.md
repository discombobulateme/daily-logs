# Daily Logs


This repo contains my daily notes from my learning path as a Software Engineer
This journey starts in [2020](./2020) as an intern for the [Open Source Program Office](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/) at Sauce Labs
Daily logs are in Markdown format
Almost every task is tagged with its type, the valid tags are below:

Language progress
- `@javascript`
- `@nodejs`
- `@python`
- `@database`
- `@vuejs`
- `@applications`
- `@integration`

Other skills
- `@selfmanagement`
- `@teamwork`
- `@opensource`
- `@community`

The dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format, for example `2020-05-27`
This is a way to measure my learning and understanding the direction my career path is taking
It is also a tool to help me balance my skills and understand where should I improve
By having a measurable tool you help yourself and others how to evaluate your work
For me, as a woman in technology, is a way to confront bias situations (gender, age, color, etc) which are within all of us

## Task counts

The script [src/index.js](src/index.js) parses the markdown files and generates totals.

```shell
npm install
npm run count
```

See [counted.md](counted.md) file for month by month totals and averages. You can also use [counted.csv](counted.csv) or [counted.json](counted.json). Mostly I spent time working on features and examples teaching our users how to use the features.

## GitHub stats

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
Month | GH | Commits | New repos | PRs | Reviews | Opened issues | Total | Level
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[November 2020](./2020/11-November-2020.md) | [Link]() | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100%
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

**Total** = new repos + PRs + reviews + opened issues

We take the first month of November 2020 as the base level of 100% and normalize the GH work against that month

**Level** = month's total / 138 \* 100
