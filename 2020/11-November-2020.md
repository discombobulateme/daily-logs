@integration
- Challenge to transform my local code into a pipeline
- Understood what a pipeline is
- GitHub actions as CI: creating a series of actions = reading my code
- GitHub actions timeout. Possibility: issue on clonning a repo in the cloud

@opensource

@teamwork
- Team feedback: held accountable about creating more workload to team when inventing new projects without sync with team first
- Pair programmed with another engineer colleague (accepting help)

@selfmanagement
- Asking questions: by asking the wrong question or not giving the proper example/ full information, people waste a lot of time :/

@integration
- GitHub actions: also not working with only one repo (Daniel's test)
- GitHub actions: steps order were wrong. Now its fixed ðŸ¥³ after a pair programing with Christian
